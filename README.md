# Common Issues to ESP-IDF (Windows Edition)

- When doing a fresh install of Python, make sure to select the option to add a PATH for Python. If not, check out this [link](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html)
- Check that you have only one Python version install. For some reason, ESP-IDF gets confused when you have multiple Python versions installed. When in doubt, uninstall the rest and do a fresh install of Python.
- Check that your pip version and packages are the latest.
- Check that your Python paths exist
- You may have to run install.bat on the esp folder
